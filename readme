www.all-athletics.com for top 20 times per year
www.trackandfieldnews.com for yearly leaders

- could use more/all years (2002-2016) for top 20 normalisation factors
- get long jump, triple jump next and try to add to curve
  (high jump, pole vault maybe trickier as discrete intervals)
- javelin too complicated. Hammer for women added late.
  Other throwing events OK but no records since 1990 in any.
  Normalisation using 2015 top 20 may show those 1980s marks as anomalous.
