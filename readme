- could use more/all years (2002-2016) for top 20 normalisation factors
DONE get long jump, triple jump next and try to add to curve
  (high jump, pole vault maybe trickier as discrete intervals)
DONE javelin too complicated. Hammer for women added late.
  Other throwing events OK but no records since 1990 in any.
  Normalisation using 2015 top 20 may show those 1980s marks as anomalous.
- 4x hurdles events

Fit all to one curve?
- throwing events show different trend so probably need to separate
- men v women?

Other predictors:
- often get 2+ breaks in quick succession probably by same person, e.g.
    M200m in 1996. So short time since last record is helpful. Long time
    since last suggests less likely to break, unless now below curve, which
    counteracts this.
